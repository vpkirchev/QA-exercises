<h3>How would you test the model of an iron? You have limited time and can only perform 5 tests. What tests would you make?</h3>
<br><br>
<b>TEST 1 </b>

Fill the water container with water, turn on the iron, wait for it to warm up, iron a piece of cloth and then turn it off.

<i>Happy path - check if the iron does what it is supposed to do </i>
<br><br><br>

<b>TEST 2 </b>

Fill the water container with water, turn on the iron, go through the different degrees of the iron and then turn it off

<i>Happy path - check whether the iron heats up properly on the different degrees </i>
<br><br><br>

<b>TEST 3 </b>

Empty the water container, turn on the iron, wait for it to warm up and try ironing a piece of cloth

<i>Check whether it can iron without any water or it will burn out </i>
<br><br><br>

<b>TEST 4 </b>

Plug the iron in a power socket that puts out voltage which is higher than the recommended one

<i>Safety check - check whether the iron will overheat/explode when it receives a higher voltage power </i>
<br><br><br>

<b>TEST 5 </b>
Leave the iron on for a longer period of time (2-3 hours)

<i>Safety check - check whether the iron will overheat when working for a longer periods of time or there are safety measures implemented that turn off the iron when it starts overheating </i>
