<b><h3>How would you test a pen? (Functional and Non-functional)</h3></b>
<br><br><br>
<i><b>Functional:</b></i>
<br><br>
<b>Whether you can write with it</b> - use the pen to write a few words on a white sheet of paper

<b>Shape:</b>
- measure the length of the pen
- measure the thickness of the pen

<b>Color</b> - use the pen to write a few words on a white sheet of paper

<b>How thick it writes</b> - use the pen to write a few words on a white sheet of paper

<b>Whether you can use the pen to write on different surfaces</b> - use the pen to write something on a piece of paper, on wood, on cardbiard, on fabric, on concrete, on piece of plastic

<b>Whether you can write with it when it is wet:</b>
- first wet the pen, then use the pen to write a few words on a piece of paper
- use the pen to write a few words on a wet piece of paper
- submerge the pen in water and try writing a few words

<b>Whether you can write with it if it is upside-down</b>

<b>Whether you can write with it at high temperatures</b> - heat up the pen (check whether the ink spills and whether it takes less or more time to dry)

<b>Whether you can write with it at low temperatures</b> - put the pen in the freezer for 4 hours and try writing something with it - does it start writing immediately?

<b>Put a ink refill which is different than the original one to see if the pen still works with it</b>

<b>If it is with a cap</b>:
- whether you can open the cap
- whether you can close the cap

<b>If it is mechanical pen:</b>
- whether you can turn it on
- whether you can turn it off


<br>
<b><i>Non-functional:</i></b>
<br><br>
<b>Whether it is comfortable to write with</b> - use the pen to write a short text with it (does it slip from the hand, are there places where it hurts/leaves scars on the hand?)

<b>How much pressure is needed for it to start writing</b>

<b>If it is with a cap</b>:
- Open and close the cap 100 times to see if it will break

<b>If it is mechanical pen:</b>
- Open and close the pen 100 times to see if the mechanism will break

<b>Endurance:</b>
- drop the pen from a high place
- step on the pen
- throw the pen into the wall
- hit the pen in the table


<b>Ink:</b>
 - how long can you write with it before it runs out of ink
 - how long does it take for the ink to dry after you write something - write something with the pen, then wait 1/2/3/4/5 seconds and rub the ink
 - does the ink thickness changes after continuous non-stop writing with the pen
 - write something with the pen, leave it open, wait 1/2/3/4/5 days and again try writing something with it (does it start writing immediately or does it need some time to start writing)
 - in a chemical way, test to see if the ink is dangerous if swallowed
 
<b>Shake the pen and check if it spills ink</b>

<b>Check if the pen has sharp parts which can cut the person using it</b>
